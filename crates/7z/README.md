# hivepack-7z

Reading 7z archives in safe Rust, ported from the 7z decoder of the [LZMA SDK](https://7-zip.org/sdk.html) (7-Zip 26.05), which is in the public domain.

> **Status:** opens what the SDK opens, encoded headers included, and decodes what it decodes (Copy, LZMA, LZMA2 and PPMd, after a branch converter, the delta filter or BCJ2), with the SDK's answers, its error numbers included, on archives 7-Zip makes and on damaged copies of them. Past the SDK, it reads what 7-Zip's program reads: any graph of coders, with Deflate, Deflate64, BZip2 and the swap filters, Zstandard as 7-Zip's forks write it, and AES with a password. This crate is not on crates.io.

```rust,no_run
use std::io::Read;

let mut archive = hivepack_7z::Archive::open(std::fs::File::open("backup.7z")?)?;
let mut files = archive.files();
while let Some(entry) = files.next()? {
    let mut data = Vec::new();
    files.read_to_end(&mut data)?;
    println!("{} {} bytes", entry.name, data.len());
}
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

Two ways to read a file's data:

- **`Archive::files`** reads the files one after another, each folder decoded once, in pieces, so that a solid block of any size takes little memory: what its coders need.
- **`Archive::extract`** decodes a file's whole folder into memory, as `SzArEx_Extract` does, and keeps it for the folder's next file.

An encrypted archive takes its password in `Options::password`, or later in `Archive::set_password` when its names can be read without it. 7z has nothing to check a password with but the data, so `Error::WrongPassword` may also be damaged data.

An archive says how much memory it needs, so `Options` limits it: the description of the archive, 1 GiB by default, and a folder's dictionaries and models, 4 GiB by default. An application that opens archives from strangers lowers them.

The goals:

- **No unsafe code.** The crate forbids it; see [docs/safety.md](../../docs/safety.md).
- **The same answers as the SDK**, error numbers included.
- **The same speed**: LZMA and LZMA2 go through [`hivepack-xz`](../xz), which is faster than the SDK's C decoder without its assembly; PPMd takes 0.92× the SDK's speed.

How the port follows the SDK, how it is checked, and what is left are in [docs/7z.md](../../docs/7z.md).

## Speed

Against the LZMA SDK 26.05's C decoder and, for what that does not read, `7zz t -mmt=1` from the same release, with `tools/7z-bench`. Above 1× the port is faster.

| | hivepack-7z / the reference |
|---|---|
| LZMA, LZMA2 and their filters, against the SDK | 1.10–1.24× |
| PPMd, against the SDK | 0.88–0.92× |
| LZMA with `lc + lp` above 4, against the SDK | 0.77× |
| Copy, against the SDK | 0.59× |
| Opening 100,000 files, against the SDK | 0.66–0.81× |
| Deflate and Deflate64, against `7zz` | 1.00–1.39× |
| BZip2 and Swap4, against `7zz` | 0.62–0.64× |
| AES-256 behind a compressor, against `7zz` | 0.87–0.93× |
| AES-256 with Copy, against `7zz` | 0.08× |

**Measured on:** AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (16 cores, x86-64), 45 GiB of memory, Ubuntu 26.04 with Linux 7.0 and the `powersave` governor, rustc 1.99.1 in the workspace's release profile, in October 2026. The SDK and `7zz` are built with GCC 15.2 and their makefile's flags, without the assembly decoders that 7-Zip's releases use. The data is the Silesia corpus cut to 64 MiB, the best of five rounds taken in turn.

The LZMA figures are against C only. AES with Copy is the processor's AES instructions in 7-Zip against constant-time AES in safe Rust. The whole table and the reasons are in [docs/7z.md](../../docs/7z.md#the-speed).

### On GitHub's runners

Against the LZMA SDK 26.05 and `7zz`, each row the mean and the range over its files or workloads.

| Port / reference | Linux x86-64 | macOS arm64 |
|---|---|---|
| Opening many files, against the SDK | 0.67× (0.61–0.72×) | 0.73× (0.61–0.85×) |
| Copy, against the SDK | 0.43× | 0.43× |
| LZMA, LZMA2 and their filters, against the SDK | 1.01× (0.87–1.06×) | 0.90× (0.82–0.92×) |

| Deflate and Deflate64, against `7zz` | 1.10× (0.92–1.29×) | 0.99× (0.79–1.20×) |
| BZip2 and Swap4, against `7zz` | 0.54× (0.46–0.62×) | 0.50× (0.39–0.61×) |
| AES-256 with Copy, against `7zz` | 0.07× | 0.06× |
| AES-256 behind a compressor, against `7zz` | 0.78× (0.76–0.79×) | 0.57× (0.53–0.62×) |

**Measured on** `.github/workflows/bench.yml`, on October 31, 2026, with rustc 1.99.1: Linux x86-64 on AMD EPYC 9V74 80-Core Processor (4 threads); macOS arm64 on Apple M2 Pro (Virtual) (5 threads). Each job gets what the runner has that day, so these are not the same processor from format to format, and they are shared machines: the ratios hold better than the speeds. Not on Windows yet, as the C side is built with POSIX tools.
