//! Compression: port of `deflate.{h,c}`.
//!
//! The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions of
//! the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a sliding
//! window trailing behind the input currently being processed). The most
//! straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for most input
//! files: try all possible matches and select the longest. The key feature
//! of this algorithm is that insertions into the string dictionary are very
//! simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided completely. Insertions
//! are performed at each input character, whereas string matches are
//! performed only when the previous match ends. So it is preferable to
//! spend more time in matches to allow very fast string insertions and
//! avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small strings is inspired
//! from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach is used to find longer
//! strings when a small match has been found.
//!
//! Differs from zlib: the stream (`z_stream`) and its state are one value,
//! [`Deflate`], whose input and output are given to each call as an
//! [`InBuffer`] and an [`OutBuffer`], as for [`crate::Inflate`].
