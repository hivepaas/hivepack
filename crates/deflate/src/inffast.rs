//! The fast decoding loop: port of `inffast.{h,c}`.

use crate::inflate::{InflateState, Mode, TABLE_SPAN};

/// Decodes literal, length and distance codes and writes literals and match
/// bytes until either not enough input or output is available, an
/// end-of-block is encountered, or a data error is encountered. When large
/// enough input and output buffers are supplied to inflate(), for example,
/// a 16K input buffer and a 64K output buffer, more than 95% of the
/// inflate execution time is spent in this routine.
///
/// Entry assumptions:
/// - `state.mode` is `Len`;
/// - at least 6 bytes of input are left at `*next_in`;
/// - at least 258 bytes of output space are left at `*next_out`;
/// - `start` is the output space inflate() had when it was called, so that
///   the output written in this call starts at `*next_out - (start -
///   left)`;
/// - `state.bits < 8`.
///
/// On return, `state.mode` is one of `Len` (not enough input or output),
/// `Type` (end of block) or `Bad` (with `*msg` set). The bytes of the bit
/// buffer that were not used are given back to the input.
///
/// Port of `inflate_fast`, `inffast.c` (without `INFLATE_STRICT` and
/// `INFLATE_ALLOW_INVALID_DISTANCE_TOOFAR_ARRR`, as zlib is built by
/// default). Differs from zlib:
/// - positions are indices into `input`, `output` and the window rather
///   than pointers;
/// - the bit buffer is refilled once per code, with eight bytes read at
///   once (fewer at the end of the input), to 56 bits or more, which is
///   enough for a length, a distance and their extra bits (at most 48).
///   zlib pulls two bytes at a time, when it has fewer than 15 bits. The
///   bits are the same: those past `bits` in `hold` are always either zero
///   or the next bits of the input, so they can be or-ed again, and the
///   bytes not used are given back at the end, as zlib gives back its own.
///   zlib's loop stops when fewer than six bytes are left past those it
///   has pulled, which depends on when it pulled them; but then it gives
///   back the bytes it did not use, and inflate() calls it again at once if
///   six or more are left, with nothing else changed. So zlib decodes a
///   code here exactly when six bytes or more are left past the bytes
///   already used, and the port's loop goes on under that same test.
