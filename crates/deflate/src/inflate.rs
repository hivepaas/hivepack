//! Decompression: port of `inflate.{h,c}`.
//!
//! `inflate()` is a state machine: each call goes as far as the input and
//! the output space allow, keeps where it stopped in [`InflateState`], and
//! goes on from there on the next call. The modes, their order and the
//! transitions between them are zlib's:
//!
//! ```text
//! Process header:
//!     HEAD -> (gzip) or (zlib) or (raw)
//!     (gzip) -> FLAGS -> TIME -> OS -> EXLEN -> EXTRA -> NAME -> COMMENT ->
//!               HCRC -> TYPE
//!     (zlib) -> DICTID or TYPE
//!     DICTID -> DICT -> TYPE
//!     (raw) -> TYPEDO
//! Read deflate blocks:
//!         TYPE -> TYPEDO -> STORED or TABLE or LEN_ or CHECK
//!         STORED -> COPY_ -> COPY -> TYPE
//!         TABLE -> LENLENS -> CODELENS -> LEN_
//!         LEN_ -> LEN
//! Read deflate codes in fixed or dynamic block:
//!             LEN -> LENEXT or LIT or TYPE
//!             LENEXT -> DIST -> DISTEXT -> MATCH -> LEN
//!             LIT -> LEN
//! Process trailer:
//!     CHECK -> LENGTH -> DONE
//! ```
//!
//! Differs from zlib: the stream (`z_stream`) and its state are one value,
//! [`Inflate`], whose input and output are given to each call as an
//! [`InBuffer`] and an [`OutBuffer`]. A call cannot be made on a stream that
//! was never initialised or already ended, so the checks zlib makes for
//! that (`inflateStateCheck`) are left out, as are the custom allocators.
