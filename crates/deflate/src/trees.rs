//! Huffman trees and block output: port of `trees.{h,c}`.
//!
//! The deflate algorithm uses two Huffman trees per block: one for literal
//! bytes and match lengths, one for match distances, both sent before the
//! block in a compressed form that a third tree, for the code lengths,
//! encodes. Literals and matches are tallied as they are found
//! ([`DeflateState::tr_tally_lit`], [`DeflateState::tr_tally_dist`]); when
//! the symbol buffer is full or a flush is asked for,
//! [`DeflateState::tr_flush_block`] builds the trees and writes the block,
//! as a stored block, with the static trees, or with its own, whichever is
//! smallest.
//!
//! zlib's static tables (`trees.h`, which `trees.c` writes with
//! `GEN_TREES_H`) are computed while compiling, with the same functions
//! (`tr_static_init`); the tests compare them with `trees.h`.
