// hivepack-rar: a port of UnRAR 7.3.2 to Rust. UnRAR's license says:
//
// UnRAR source code may be used in any software to handle RAR archives
// without limitations free of charge, but cannot be used to develop RAR
// (WinRAR) compatible archiver and to re-create RAR compression algorithm,
// which is proprietary. Distribution of modified UnRAR source code in
// separate form or as a part of other software is permitted, provided that
// full text of this paragraph, starting from "UnRAR source code" words, is
// included in license, or in documentation if license is not available, and
// in source code comments of resulting package.

//! What went wrong: UnRAR's exit codes, which its `ErrHandler` keeps
//! (errhnd.cpp), and the errors that stop reading.
