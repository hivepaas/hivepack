//! Reading XAR archives in safe Rust, ported from libarchive 3.8.10's
//! reader (`archive_read_support_format_xar.c`).
//!
//! XAR is the archive format of macOS's installer packages (`.pkg`), of
//! `.xip` files and of Safari extensions. [`Reader`] reads its files in
//! the order of their `id` in the table of contents: paths, types,
//! permissions, owners, times, devices, inodes, hard and symbolic links,
//! file flags and extended attributes, and the data decompressed (gzip,
//! bzip2, lzma or xz) with its checksums checked (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 or
//! SHA-512). Each entry comes with what libarchive gives for it, warnings
//! included, and the same errors.
//!
//! The table of contents is XML, read by a port of the parts of libxml2
//! 2.15.4 that libarchive uses (its `xmlTextReader`), so that a damaged
//! one reads as it does with libarchive.
//!
//! The rules the port follows, and how it is checked against libarchive,
//! are in the repository: `docs/xar.md`.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io::Read;
//!
//! let mut xar = hivepack_xar::Reader::seekable(std::fs::File::open("Install.pkg")?);
//! while let Some(header) = xar.next()? {
//!     let mut data = Vec::new();
//!     xar.read_to_end(&mut data)?;
//!     let path = header.path.unwrap_or_default();
//!     println!("{} {} bytes", String::from_utf8_lossy(&path), data.len());
//! }
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
