# hivepack-xz

.xz and .lzma compression, and .xz, .lzma and .lz decompression, in safe Rust, ported from the official library, liblzma of [XZ Utils](https://tukaani.org/xz/) 5.8.4.

> **Status:** the encoders of `.xz` and `.lzma` and of raw LZMA1 and LZMA2 write liblzma's output, byte for byte, call by call, with every preset, option and match finder and every flush, at about liblzma's speed. The decoders of `.xz`, `.lzma` and `.lz`, the automatic one, and raw LZMA1 and LZMA2 give liblzma's results, call by call, with its memory limits and flags; they run at 1.06–1.34× liblzma's speed where liblzma is C, and at 0.74–0.89× on x86-64, where liblzma's range decoder is assembly (Silesia). The delta and BCJ filters (x86, PowerPC, IA-64, ARM, ARM-Thumb, ARM64, SPARC, RISC-V) are in both, and the `.xz` encoder and decoder run in threads too. This crate is not on crates.io.

```rust
use hivepack_xz::{Action, InBuffer, OutBuffer, Status, Stream};

let mut xz = vec![0; hivepack_xz::stream_buffer_bound(5)];
let mut len = 0;
hivepack_xz::easy_buffer_encode(6, hivepack_xz::Check::CRC64, b"hello", &mut xz, &mut len)?;
let xz = &xz[..len];
let mut stream = Stream::stream_decoder(u64::MAX, 0)?;
let mut out = vec![0; 1 << 20];
let mut output = OutBuffer::new(&mut out);
let status = stream.code(&mut output, &mut InBuffer::new(xz), Action::Finish)?;
assert_eq!(status, Status::StreamEnd);
```

The goals:

- **No unsafe code.** The crate forbids it; see [docs/safety.md](../../docs/safety.md).
- **The same results as liblzma**: the same output, byte for byte, return codes, bytes read and written, memory usage and limits.
- **The same speed as liblzma**, on x86-64 and arm64.

How the port follows liblzma, how it is checked, and what is left are in [docs/xz.md](../../docs/xz.md).

## Speed

Against liblzma 5.8.4, with `tools/xz-bench`, on the 12 Silesia files with CRC64. Above 1× the port is faster.

| | Mean | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Compression, presets 0, 3, 6 and 9 | 1.02× | 0.93–1.18× |
| Decompression, against liblzma with its x86-64 assembly | 0.81× | 0.74–0.89× |
| Decompression, against liblzma's C | 1.18× | 1.06–1.34× |

**Measured on:** AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (x86-64, Linux), in October 2026, the best of two or three rounds taken in turn. Threads and more are in [docs/xz.md](../../docs/xz.md#the-speed-target).

### On GitHub's runners

Against liblzma 5.8.4, each row the mean and the range over its files or workloads.

| Port / reference | Linux x86-64 | Windows x86-64 | macOS arm64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decompression | 0.79× (0.71–0.87×) | 1.04× (0.96–1.13×) | 1.01× (0.89–1.18×) |
| Compression, presets 0 and 6 | 1.00× (0.89–1.06×) | 1.01× (0.91–1.08×) | 1.04× (0.91–1.16×) |

**Measured on** `.github/workflows/bench.yml`, on October 31, 2026, with rustc 1.99.1: Linux x86-64 on AMD EPYC 7763 64-Core Processor (4 threads); Windows x86-64 on AMD64 Family 25 Model 1 Stepping 1 (4 threads); macOS arm64 on Apple M1 (Virtual) (3 threads). Each job gets what the runner has that day, so these are not the same processor from format to format, and they are shared machines: the ratios hold better than the speeds. Linux's decompression is below 1× as liblzma has x86-64 assembly for it there; why Windows, with x86-64 too, is near 1× has not been looked into.
