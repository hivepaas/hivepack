//! The LZ-based encoder: the sliding window and the match finders. Port of
//! `lz/lz_encoder.{h,c}`, `lz/lz_encoder_hash.h` and `lz/lz_encoder_mf.c`.
//!
//! Basic steps:
//!  1. Input gets copied into the dictionary.
//!  2. Data in dictionary gets run through the match finder byte by byte.
//!  3. The literals and matches are encoded using e.g. LZMA.
//!
//! The bytes that have been ran through the match finder, but not encoded
