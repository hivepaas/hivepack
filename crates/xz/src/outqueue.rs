//! The output queue of the threaded coders: port of `common/outqueue.c`.
//!
//! liblzma's buffers are a linked list of structures with the data after
//! them, which a worker thread writes while the main thread reads what it
//! has finished. Here the queue is a `VecDeque` of [`OutBuf`] behind the
//! coder's mutex, as liblzma reads it, and a worker takes the data of its
//! buffer ([`OutBuf::buf`]) while it writes, and gives it back when it has
//! finished: the encoder's main thread reads only finished data. The
//! decoder's reads what a worker has moved there so far, under the mutex.
