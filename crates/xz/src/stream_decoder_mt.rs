//! The threaded .xz decoder: port of `common/stream_decoder_mt.c`.
//!
//! As in [`stream_encoder_mt`](crate::stream_encoder_mt), liblzma's threads,
//! mutexes and condition variables are `std::thread`, `Mutex` and `Condvar`,
//! each mutex holding what liblzma's protects.
//!
//! Differs from liblzma, without a difference to see: liblzma's main thread
//! writes a Block's input into the worker's buffer while the worker reads
//! the part before it, and reads the output of the oldest Block from the
//! worker's buffer while the worker writes the part after it. Here the main
//! thread appends the input to [`WorkerShared::pending`], which the worker
//! moves to its own buffer, and the worker writes its output to a buffer of
//! its own, which it moves to the output queue under the coder's mutex where
//! liblzma updates `outbuf->pos`: the whole buffer the first time, as little
//! has to be copied, and what it has written since then the other times.
