//! The threaded .xz encoder: port of `common/stream_encoder_mt.c`.
//!
//! liblzma's threads and its mutexes and condition variables
//! (`mythread.h`) are `std::thread`, `Mutex` and `Condvar`. Each Mutex
//! holds what liblzma's mutex protects: [`Shared`] the coder's, with the
//! output queue, which liblzma reads under it; [`WorkerShared`] a
//! worker's. The rest is the main thread's ([`StreamEncoderMt`]) or the
//! worker's own ([`WorkerLocal`]).
//!
//! Differs from liblzma, without a difference to see: liblzma's main
//! thread writes the input of a Block into the worker's buffer while the
//! worker reads the part before it; here the main thread appends it to
//! [`WorkerShared::pending`], which the worker moves to its own buffer
//! ([`take_pending`]).
//! The worker writes its output to a buffer it has taken from the output
//! queue and gives back when it has finished, as liblzma's main thread
//! reads only finished Blocks.
