//! PPMd, ZIP's method 98, which libzip does not read: PPMd var.I rev. 1
//! [APPNOTE 5.10], with `ppmd8.rs`, the port of 7-Zip's. Decompressing
//! only.
//!
//! The data starts with two bytes, little-endian: the model's order less
//! one in bits 0 to 3, its memory in MiB less one in bits 4 to 11, and how
//! it is restored when that runs out in bits 12 to 15; the range coder's
//! bytes follow, to the end of the payload's marker. It is read as 7-Zip's
//! ZIP handler reads it (its PPMd decoder in full file mode, which needs
//! the marker): an order of 1 or a restore method past 2 is a data error,
//! the third method (freezing the model) not supported, as 7-Zip is built
//! without it; and after the marker, the range decoder must have ended
//! where the data does. What follows the data is the compressing layer's
//! to check, as for the other methods: with `ZIP_CHECKCONS` only, where
//! 7-Zip always refuses it.
