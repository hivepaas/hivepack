//! Port of `common/pool.c`: the pool of worker threads that multithreaded
//! compression hands its jobs to. `common/threading.c`, libzstd's wrapper
//! over pthreads and Windows threads, is `std::thread` and `std::sync`.
//!
//! Only what `zstdmt_compress.c` uses: a pool made for a number of
//! threads (`POOL_create_advanced`, with a queue of size 0), resized
//! (`POOL_resize`), given a job only when a thread is free to take it
//! (`POOL_tryAdd`), and freed once its jobs are done (`POOL_free`). Shared
//! between contexts, it is `ZSTD_threadPool`
//! ([`ThreadPool`](crate::ThreadPool)).
//!
//! Differs from libzstd: libzstd's queue of size 0 is a ring of one slot;
//! here a queue that holds at most one job for the same reason. A job is a
//! value the pool's function runs, as libzstd's is the argument of its
//! function pointer, and a job refused comes back to the caller.
