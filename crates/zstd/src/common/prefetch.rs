//! `PREFETCH_L1` of `common/compiler.h`: a hint that a piece of a table is
//! about to be read, so that the processor brings it into its first-level
//! cache meanwhile. Only the encoder's row match finder uses it, where
//! libzstd does (`zstd_lazy.c`).
//!
//! With the `unsafe-fast` feature, on aarch64 and x86-64, it is the
//! instruction libzstd's macro gives there: `prfm pldl1keep` and
//! `prefetcht0`. Elsewhere, and without the feature, it does nothing, and
//! [`PREFETCH`] is false: the match finder then keeps the order of work that
//! is faster without it. This module's two blocks are the encoder's only
//! `unsafe` code. See `docs/unsafe.md`.
//!
//! Stable Rust has no safe prefetch: `core::arch`'s and inline assembly
//! need `unsafe`, and `std::hint::prefetch_read`, which does not, is still
//! unstable (`hint_prefetch`).
