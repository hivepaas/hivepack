//! Port of the parts of `compress/zstd_compress.c` about sequences given
//! from outside the match finder: frames compressed from the caller's
//! sequences (`ZSTD_compressSequences`, `ZSTD_compressSequencesAndLiterals`),
//! blocks whose sequences come from a sequence producer of the caller's
//! (`ZSTD_registerSequenceProducer`, and its part of `ZSTD_buildSeqStore`),
//! and the sequences a frame would have (`ZSTD_generateSequences`, with the
//! sequence collector). A module of its own for its size, as a part of
//! `zstd_compress.rs`, whose context it works on.
//!
//! libzstd trusts the sequences it is given unless told to check them
