//! The `dfast` strategy's match finder: port of
//! `compress/zstd_double_fast.c`.
//!
//! Two hash tables: a long one, of 8-byte hashes (the match state's hash
//! table), and a short one of `minMatch`-byte hashes (its chain table).
//! Positions are indices into `src`, the buffer the window's prefix is in,
//! and `dict`, the one its older segment is in; the tables hold window
//! indices, `position + window.base` (or `window.dict_base`). The extDict
//! variant cuts the two segments out of those buffers, and its positions
//! are in the segments. The dictMatchState variant also reads the content
//! of the `CDict` the frame is attached to, at its own indices.
