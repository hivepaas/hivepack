//! Port of `compress/zstdmt_compress.c`: compression on several threads.
//!
//! A frame streamed with workers (`ZSTD_c_nbWorkers`) is cut into jobs of
//! its input, which a pool of threads ([`Pool`]) compresses side by side,
//! while the caller's thread takes the input, cuts it into jobs, and
//! writes out their output in order. A job compresses its input as blocks
//! of the one frame, with a context of its own: the first job writes the
//! frame header (and has the frame's dictionary), the last one the last
//! block. Each job after the first loads the end of the input before it
//! as raw content, its prefix (the overlap), starts with no repeat offsets
//! (the decoder's are those the job before left, which it does not know),
//! and writes no frame header. What must go through the input in order,
//! the frame's checksum and long distance matching, each job does in
//! turn before it compresses (the serial state).
//!
//! The frames do not depend on the number of threads, nor on their
//! timing: where a job ends depends only on the input and on the calls
//! (it is full, a flush or the end of the frame comes, or, with
//! `ZSTD_c_rsyncable`, the content says), and what a job writes only on
//! its input, its prefix, the parameters and the frame's dictionary. How
//! much input a call takes, and how much it writes out, depends on how far
//! the threads have got.
//!
//! Differs from libzstd, in how memory is managed, with the same jobs:
//! - **Input.** libzstd copies the input into a round buffer, where each
//!   job reads its input and prefix in place, and a call takes no input
//!   while the part of the buffer to fill is still used by a job not
//!   done, or by the window of long distance matching
//!   (`ZSTDMT_tryGetInputRange`, `ZSTDMT_waitForLdmComplete`). The port
//!   copies each job's prefix and input into a buffer of the job's own,
//!   which the job gives back once it is done; a call never waits for
//!   room.
//!   The input held is still bounded: one buffer being filled, one job
//!   waiting for a thread, and one job per thread. A job's input ends
//!   after the same bytes as libzstd's, and its prefix is the same bytes.
//! - **Output.** Each job compresses into a buffer of the size libzstd
//!   gives it, `ZSTD_compressBound` of the job size, and copies what each
//!   chunk adds to where the caller's thread reads it from (libzstd's
//!   thread reads the job's buffer).
//! - **Long distance matching.** It runs on the input in order, with a
//!   window of its own over the whole input, as libzstd's serial state
//!   does; libzstd's window lies in the round buffer, and has its older
//!   segment where the buffer wraps around. The port keeps the input that
//!   window can reach in a buffer of its own, one segment. Its indices
//!   are libzstd's, and its matches the same: the round buffer always
//!   holds more than the window's size before each job, so that libzstd's
//!   segments only ever end below what the window's maximum distance
//!   keeps, and a match across them reads the bytes that follow.
//! - **Pools.** No pools of buffers of sequences (`ZSTDMT_seqPool`): each
//!   job gets the sequences of long distance matching from the serial
//!   state. Contexts and output buffers are kept for later jobs, as in
//!   libzstd, and so are the jobs' input buffers and the copies of their
//!   output, whose memory is then mapped already, as libzstd's round buffer
//!   is.
