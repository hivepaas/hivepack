# Porting zlib

`hivepack-deflate` is a port of the official Deflate library, [zlib](https://zlib.net), to safe Rust. ZIP needs it first (see [zip.md](zip.md)), and gzip and every other Deflate-based format will use it too. The goal is the one [porting.md](porting.md) sets for zstd: the same output as zlib, at the same speed.

## The version

The port follows zlib **1.3.2** (tag `v1.3.2`, commit `da607da739fa6047df13e66a2af6b8bec7c2a498`, February 2026), the latest release as of October 2026. `hivepack_deflate::UPSTREAM_VERSION` names it.

## What following the official code means

The rules of [porting.md](porting.md):

- **The same layout.** Each file of zlib becomes a module of the same name: `inflate.c` becomes `crates/deflate/src/inflate.rs`, `inffixed.h` becomes `inffixed.rs`.
- **The same names**, in snake case, with the C name in every doc comment. A stream and its state are one type, `Inflate` or `Deflate`, whose methods drop the prefix: `inflateSetDictionary` becomes `Inflate::set_dictionary`, `deflateParams` becomes `Deflate::params`.
- **The same algorithms, constants and tables.** The fixed-code tables of `inffixed.h` are copied as they are. The CRC tables of `crc32.h` and the static trees of `trees.h` are computed while compiling, by the functions zlib uses to write those files, and tests compare them with the files. The compressor's configuration table is zlib's. That is what makes the output identical.
- **The same results.** A call returns zlib's code, as `Result<Status, Error>`, and an error carries the message zlib leaves in `strm->msg`, such as `"invalid distance too far back"`.
- **Differences are marked** with a comment starting `Differs from zlib:`.

The main difference is the stream itself. zlib's `z_stream` holds pointers to the caller's input and output; the port takes them for each call as an `InBuffer` and an `OutBuffer`, a slice and a position, as `hivepack-zstd` does. Positions in the window, the code tables and the buffers are indices. A stream cannot be used before it is initialised or after it ends, so the checks zlib makes for that (`inflateStateCheck`, `deflateStateCheck`) have nothing to check.

The compressor keeps zlib's memory layout where the output depends on it: the symbol buffer overlays the pending output in one buffer (`pending_buf`), and the window's bytes past the input are those zlib leaves there. The few other differences:

- A gzip header's name and comment end at their first zero byte, or at their end; zlib needs the zero and would read past a buffer without one. An extra field shorter than `extra_len` is written with zeros after it.
- The operating system written in a gzip header is the one zlib's build would write: 3 (Unix), 10 on Windows, 19 on Apple systems.
- `deflateParams`, which calls `deflate()` with the stream's current buffers, takes them as arguments: `Deflate::params(output, input, level, strategy)`.
- The Deflate64 decoder, `InflateBack9`, has its own 64K window, which zlib's caller gives `inflateBack9Init`. Its `in()` and `out()` are the traits `BackIn` and `BackOut`, and the input it leaves unused, which zlib puts back in `strm->next_in` and `strm->avail_in`, comes with its result.

## How it is shown

The reference is zlib 1.3.2 itself, reached two ways: built from the sources bundled in `libz-sys` 1.1.30 (its `static` feature, so that a system zlib of another version is never used) and called through `flate2`, both development dependencies only; and `tools/zlib-oracle`, a small C program built from the zlib 1.3.2 release by `scripts/testdata.py`, as `tools/zstd-oracle` is for libzstd.

- **`tests/deflate.rs`** compresses the same inputs with the port and with zlib, in the same random pieces of input and output, with the same flushes (none, sync, full, partial, finish). Every call must return the same result and read and write the same number of bytes, and the bytes must be the same: at every level from −1 to 9, raw, zlib and gzip, with windows of 512 bytes to 32 KiB, on text, random bytes, runs, long-distance matches, `testdata`'s files and, where it is fetched, 400 KB of five Silesia files.
- **`tests/zlib.rs`** decompresses streams that zlib's own compressor wrote, with the port and with zlib, in the same pieces of input and output, chosen at random from one byte up. Every call must return the same result and message and read and write the same number of bytes, and the output must be the same. The streams are raw, zlib and gzip; at levels 0, 1, 6 and 9; with windows of 512 bytes to 32 KiB; with sync, full and partial flushes in between; with preset dictionaries, right and wrong; decompressed with a smaller window than they need; with a gzip header that has every field; and 2,880 of them damaged, with bytes changed, bits flipped and cut short. The inputs are text, random bytes, runs, matches from up to 40 KiB back, and the uncompressed files in `testdata/zstd/golden-compression`.
- **`tests/oracle.rs`** reaches what `flate2` cannot: `Flush::Block` and `Flush::Trees`, `data_type`, `inflateMark`, `inflatePrime`, `inflateSync`, `inflateValidate`, dictionaries set at any point, and the gzip header fields, on streams from every level, window, memory level, strategy and flush (`Z_BLOCK` included) of zlib's compressor, some of them damaged. Each request is a stream and a list of calls; the port must answer each call as zlib does: the result, bytes read and written, `data_type`, `inflateMark` and `msg`, then the totals, the check value, a hash of the output and the header. About 1,800 requests are compared with zlib where the oracle is built (Linux and macOS in CI), and `testdata/oracle/inflate.txt` replays 1,173 earlier answers everywhere else, including Windows, 32-bit and big-endian machines.

  The compressor is compared the same way, through the oracle's `deflate2` requests, for what `flate2` cannot set: every memory level and strategy (`Z_FILTERED`, `Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY`, `Z_RLE`, `Z_FIXED`), parameters out of range, gzip headers with every field, dictionaries before and between blocks, `deflateParams` and `deflateTune` between calls, `deflatePrime`, `deflateBound`, `Z_BLOCK`, and output space from none up. Each call is answered with the result, bytes read and written, `data_type`, `deflatePending`, `deflateUsed` and `msg`, then the totals, the check value and a hash of the output. About 800 requests are compared live, and `testdata/oracle/deflate.txt` replays 586.
- **`tests/deflate64.rs`** compares Deflate64 decoding with zlib's `contrib/infback9`, through the oracle's `inflate9` requests. zlib has no Deflate64 compressor, so the test makes the streams: stored, fixed and dynamic blocks, with random complete codes up to 15 bits, lengths up to 65,538 and distances up to 65,536, knowing the data each decodes to. Some are damaged, some code a distance their table leaves out, and deflate streams and random bytes are given too. Each is decoded by `inflateBack9` with its input in random pieces and an `out()` that fails now and then; the port must give the same result and message, the same input left unused, the same number of `in()` and `out()` calls and the same output. Every message of `infback9.c` comes up. About 600 requests are compared live, `testdata/oracle/inflate9.txt` replays 414, and on every machine the generated streams must decode to their data.
- **`tests/infcover.rs`** is zlib's own coverage test of inflate, `test/infcover.c`, ported with the same inputs and expected results, including the messages of every data error.
- **Unit tests** compare the CRC tables with `crc32.h` and the static trees with `trees.h`, build `inffixed.h`'s tables with the ported `inflate_table` as zlib's `makefixed()` does, and `inffix9.h`'s with `inflate_table9` (whose entries for the two unused length symbols, 286 and 287, are from an older table, but are invalid codes either way), and check CRC-32 and Adler-32, combined or not, against their definitions.
- **`fuzz/fuzz_targets/inflate.rs`** and **`deflate.rs`** do what `tests/zlib.rs` and `tests/deflate.rs` do, with the fuzzer's input as the stream or the data (see [fuzz/README.md](../fuzz/README.md)). **`inflate9.rs`** decodes its input as Deflate64 all at once and in pieces, which must agree.

## The speed target

At least 0.95× zlib's speed, as for zstd, measured with `tools/deflate-bench` on the Silesia corpus (`python3 scripts/testdata.py fetch --group bench` fetches it):

```sh
cargo run --release -p deflate-bench -- [--levels 1,6,9] [--stream | --compress] target/testdata/silesia
```

With `--compress`, the tool also checks that the port's streams are zlib's, byte for byte.

### Where compression stands

The port as it is, with no speed work: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (x86-64, Linux), October 2026, Silesia at levels 1, 6 and 9, one call each, best of three rounds taken in turn:

| | Mean | Range | At 0.95× or more |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compression | 0.99× zlib | 0.95–1.03× | 36 of 36 |

Every stream was zlib's, byte for byte.

### Where decompression stands

AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (x86-64, Linux), October 2026, the Silesia corpus compressed by zlib at levels 1, 6 and 9, best of three rounds taken in turn:

| | Mean | Range | At 0.95× or more |
|---|---|---|---|
| In one call | 1.00× zlib | 0.92–1.09× | 34 of 36 |
| Streaming, in pieces of 16 KiB as zlib's `zpipe.c` | 1.05× | 0.95–1.14× | 36 of 36 |

It was 0.82× in one call (0.71–0.86×) and 0.90× streaming before the speed work, all of it in `inflate_fast`. What made the difference, the largest first, measured at level 6 in one call:

- **Eight bytes of input at once.** zlib pulls two bytes into its bit buffer whenever it has fewer than 15 bits, up to six times per length and distance. The port reads eight bytes once per code, to 56 bits or more, which is enough for a length, a distance and their extra bits (48 at most). The bits past those counted are the input's next bits, so they can be or-ed in again. 0.83× to 0.94×.

  Where the loop stops has to be zlib's too, or an error found by one loop and not the other leaves a different `inflateMark`. zlib's loop stops when fewer than six bytes are left past those it has pulled, which depends on when it pulled them; but it then gives back the bytes it did not use, and inflate() calls it again at once if six or more are left. So zlib decodes a code in its fast loop exactly when six bytes or more are left past the bytes already used, and the port's loop tests that, which costs nothing. The first version of the speed work needed eight bytes to enter the loop, and `tests/oracle.rs` found the difference.
- **Matches copied eight bytes at a time**, when they start at least eight bytes back, each piece read from bytes already written. zlib copies three bytes per loop; byte by byte, every one was a bounds check. +3%.
- **Runs of one byte filled**: matches one byte back, the commonest of those that overlap. +2%, and 11% on `mr`.
- **Tables of a fixed size.** `inflate_fast` takes each code table as an array of 1024 entries (the most a table needs is 852), so an index masked with 1023 needs no bounds check. +1%.

Tried, and not worth it: copying matches two to seven bytes back eight bytes at a time too, from the nearest multiple of their distance that is eight or more back. That made decompression 9% slower on average, and is not in the port.

The slowest inputs are text at level 1, mostly literals. arm64 is not measured yet.

### Deflate64

zlib's `contrib/infback9` has no fast loop: it decodes one code at a time and pulls one byte at a time, and so does the port. A zlib stream with no length code 285 decodes the same as Deflate64; at level 6 that is three of the Silesia files. Timed by hand (`tools/deflate-bench` cannot reach `infback9`, which `libz-sys` does not bundle), same machine, best of seven runs:

| File | Port | zlib's `infback9` | |
|---|---|---|---|
| osdb | 550 MB/s | 492 MB/s | 1.12× |
| sao | 370 MB/s | 360 MB/s | 1.03× |
| x-ray | 255 MB/s | 265 MB/s | 0.96× |

It was 0.92–0.94× as first ported. The codes of a block are now decoded in a loop of their own, with the block's tables looked up once, and a match that does not overlap the bytes it writes is copied at once rather than byte by byte.

## Progress

## Not ported, for now

- `infback.c`: `inflateBack`, a callback interface to the same decoder.
- `gzlib.c`, `gzread.c`, `gzwrite.c`, `gzclose.c`: reading and writing gzip files. The gzip format itself is in `inflate.c` and is ported.
- Parts that exist only because zlib is in C: custom allocators (`zalloc`, `zfree`), the version checks of `inflateInit_` and `deflateInit_`, the `method` argument of `deflateInit2` (always `Z_DEFLATED`), the checks of a null or uninitialised stream, and building the CRC tables on first use (`DYNAMIC_CRC_TABLE`).
- Build options that zlib leaves off by default: `INFLATE_STRICT`, `INFLATE_ALLOW_INVALID_DISTANCE_TOOFAR_ARRR` (so `inflateUndermine` always fails, as in a default build), `PKZIP_BUG_WORKAROUND`, `BUILDFIXED`, the ARMv8 CRC instructions, and in the compressor `FASTEST`, `LIT_MEM`, `UNALIGNED_OK`, `FORCE_STATIC`, `FORCE_STORED`, `GEN_TREES_H` and `ZLIB_DEBUG`.
- `contrib/`, except `infback9`.

## Following new releases

When zlib releases a new version:

1. Diff the two tags and port each change.
2. Update `UPSTREAM_VERSION` and the `libz-sys` version that bundles the new release.
3. Run everything again.

## Licenses

The port is derived from zlib, which is under the zlib license. That is why `hivepack-deflate` is under the zlib license, and its [LICENSE](../crates/deflate/LICENSE) keeps zlib's notice and says that this is an altered version, as the license asks. `tests/infcover.rs` is derived from zlib's `test/infcover.c`, under the same license.
