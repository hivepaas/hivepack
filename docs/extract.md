# Extracting safely

`hivepack-extract` writes an archive's entries to disk, and is safe by default: nothing is written outside the destination, through a link, over what is there, or past limits set against archive bombs. It extracts ZIP archives that `hivepack-zip` opened, tar archives that `hivepack-tar` reads, cpio archives that `hivepack-cpio` reads (RPM packages' payloads among them), ISO 9660 images that `hivepack-iso` reads and UDF volumes that `hivepack-udf` mounts, with the same checks and the same writing; RAR will too.

Extractors no longer break on memory, which safe Rust settles, but on logic, and memory-safe code gets that wrong as often as C: writing through a link (the `zip` crate's CVE-2025-29787, adm-zip's CVE-2026-76845), keeping setuid bits or chmod through a link (RUSTSEC-2026-0367 and 0369), links that point outside (RUSTSEC-2026-0368), alternate data streams on Windows (WinRAR's CVE-2025-8088, exploited), and Python's tarfile filter, which took five CVEs in June 2025 for checking strings and `realpath`. The rules below answer those, and come from the research behind this repository's ZIP plan.

> **Status:** names, the same path twice, links, overlapping data, the limits, writing by handle, integrity, masked permissions and times, the options that relax them, a time limit, cancelling and progress, names compared as file systems compare them, and marks of origin: done, for ZIP, checked on libzip's test archives, Fifield's bombs, ZipDiff's archives, the archives behind sixteen CVEs (see [the table](#the-archives-behind-cves)) and Unicode's own tests, and fuzzed; and for tar (see [tar](#tar)), checked on Go's test archives and fuzzed; for cpio (see [cpio](#cpio)), checked on libarchive's test archives and fuzzed; for ISO 9660 and UDF (see [UDF](#udf)), checked on libarchive's test images and on volumes Linux reads, and fuzzed. Next: RAR (see [What comes next](#what-comes-next)).

## Refuse, do not repair

Other extractors clean names up: Python drops `..` and drive letters, UnZip drops `../`. Two of them clean the same name differently (`foo/../bar` becomes `foo/bar` in one and `bar` in another), and that difference is itself an attack (ZipDiff, USENIX Security 2025). `hivepack-extract` refuses instead, with the same rules on every system, so that an archive extracts the same everywhere or not at all.

A name is refused (`check_name`, `NameError`) when it:

| Has | Because |
|---|---|
| nothing, or an empty component (`a//b`) | |
| bytes that are not UTF-8, once decoded from CP437 for a name without the UTF-8 flag | |
| a control character (U+0001 to U+001F, DEL) or NUL, in the decoded name or the raw bytes | libzip decodes CP437 0x01 as ☺; an extractor that takes the bytes as they are sees a control character |
| a backslash | Windows takes it for a separator |
| a leading `/` | absolute |
| a colon | a drive (`C:`), or an NTFS alternate data stream (`a.txt:hidden`) |
| `<`, `>`, `"`, `\|`, `?` or `*` | Windows does not allow them in names, so an archive that has them extracts on Linux and fails half way on Windows |
| a component `.` or `..` | climbs out |
| a Windows device name, with or without extension, in any case: `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM0`–`COM9`, `LPT0`–`LPT9`, `COM¹`–`COM³`, `LPT¹`–`LPT³`, `CONIN$`, `CONOUT$` | names a device in every directory |
| a component ending in a space or a dot | Windows drops them, so `a.` and `a` are one file |
| a component longer than 255 bytes | file systems refuse it |

Two entries may not name the same path either: compared as a case-insensitive file system, and macOS, compare them, which stops a file and a directory of one name (WinRAR's CVE-2023-38831), a path written through another's case, and one name written two ways. A directory entry may follow the files in it.

Names are compared by their key, Unicode's canonical caseless match (definition D145): NFD(fold(NFD(name))), the canonical decomposition of the full case folding of the canonical decomposition. So `é` as one character (U+00E9) and as `e` and a combining accent (U+0065 U+0301), which macOS takes for one name and Linux for two, are one name here; and so are the Kelvin sign and `K`, one by canonical decomposition as macOS takes them, `σ` and `ς`, one by case folding as NTFS takes them, and `ß` and `ss` or the ligature `ﬁ` and `fi`, which macOS folds into one (its CI run found it: it refused `fi` after `ﬁ`). Each system joins some of these, and the key joins all of them, so that an archive extracts the same everywhere or not at all. Compatibility forms that do not fold stay apart: the fullwidth `Ａ` is not `A`, nor `①` `1`. Without the check, a second name written another way stops the extraction at its write, as `Exists`, after the first is written; with it, before anything is.

The tables are this crate's own, in safe Rust, for one Unicode version on every system (`UNICODE_VERSION`, 18.0.0), rather than the standard library's, whose version moves with Rust, or `unicode-normalization`, which has `unsafe` code. `scripts/unicode.py` makes them from the Unicode Character Database (`UnicodeData.txt` and `CaseFolding.txt`, the `unicode-18.0.0` test data set); the tests check them against the same files for every character, run Unicode's own `NormalizationTest.txt` (20,171 lines, and every character it does not list decomposing to itself), and check that a key is its own key. Raising the version is changing it in the script and the manifest, and running the script.

## Links and special files

Symbolic links (from the Unix mode of the external attributes) are refused, unless the options say otherwise.

A device, FIFO or socket in a ZIP archive is only a mode with data: Info-ZIP's `zip` records the mode of what it reads, a pipe for standard input (the entry `-` of libzip's `streamed.zip` and `zip64.zip`). Such an entry is written as a file with its data; nothing is ever created as what the mode says.

## Writing by handle

Checking a path and then writing to it lets a link put in between be followed. Every write goes through handles instead: the destination is opened once, each directory under it is opened from its parent's handle without following a link, and each file is created new (`O_CREAT|O_EXCL`, `O_NOFOLLOW`; `CREATE_NEW` on Windows). So a link already in the destination, or one put there while extracting, is not followed: a directory on the way that is a link stops the extraction (`NotADirectory`), and so does a file that is there (`Exists`). Nothing is overwritten.

The standard library cannot do this yet: its directory handles (`std::fs::Dir`) are not stable. cap-std does it, with `openat2` and `RESOLVE_BENEATH` on Linux 5.6 and later, `openat` with `O_NOFOLLOW` a component at a time elsewhere on Unix, and handles relative to a directory's on Windows; it is a dependency with `unsafe` code, in this crate only (see [safety.md](safety.md#dependencies-with-unsafe-code)), and `std::fs::Dir` replaces it once stable.

The destination itself is the caller's: it is created if it is not there, and its path is followed as given.

## Limits

An archive's sizes are what it says, and archive bombs say what gets them past a check: adm-zip believed them three times in 2026 alone. `Limits` count what is actually written:

| Limit | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `max_entries` | 100,000 | counted before anything is read |
| `max_entry_size` | 4 GiB | |
| `max_total_size` | 16 GiB | |
| `max_ratio` | 2,000 | bytes written for each compressed byte, once an entry has written `ratio_threshold` (1 MiB). Deflate tops out near 1,032 to one, which a file of zeros reaches, so this stops only methods that go further: Deflate64, and bzip2, LZMA, XZ, Zstandard and PPMd, whose files of zeros reach far beyond it and need a higher limit |

The sizes the archive declares are checked against the limits before anything is written, then the data is counted as it comes, and an entry stops as soon as it passes a limit or the size it declared (`SizeMismatch`). Nothing is allocated from a declared size.

Entries whose compressed data overlap are refused before anything is written. That is how David Fifield's bombs work, 42 kB to 5.5 GB or 46 MB to 4.5 PB with Zip64: many entries, one stream. The data ranges are sorted and each compared with the one before, which catches the "quoted" form too, whose entries each hold the next one's header.

The defaults are a judgment, to be tuned on real archives; each can be raised.

## Integrity, permissions and times

Every entry's data is checked at its end, its CRC-32, or for WinZip AES its authentication code, by `hivepack-zip`; a file whose data fails is removed, as is one cut off at a limit, and the extraction stops. Encrypted entries are read with `Options::password`.

On Unix, a file gets the permission bits its entry has, masked as Python's `data` filter masks them: no setuid, setgid or sticky bit, nothing writable by group or others, and readable and writable by its owner. Owners, ACLs and extended attributes are not restored. Directories get the system's default permissions. Files and directories get the time their entry has, the directories once nothing more is written in them, the deepest first, without following a link. A time the system cannot hold (after January 2038 where `time_t` has 32 bits) is left: the file keeps the time it was written at.

## Marks of origin

A downloaded archive carries a mark of where it came from, which the system checks before a file is opened or run: Windows' Mark of the Web, a `Zone.Identifier` stream with the zone (`ZoneId=3` for the internet) and the address, and macOS's quarantine, the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute that Gatekeeper reads. A file extracted without it escapes the check: 7-Zip's CVE-2025-0411, exploited, was nested archives losing it.

`Origin::of` reads the mark an archive's file has, and `Options::origin` carries it, as it is, to every file written: on Windows the stream is opened from the file's own handle (`:Zone.Identifier` relative to it, so no path is resolved again, and a file named `a` is not taken for drive A); on macOS the attribute is set on the file's descriptor, and on every directory created too, as Gatekeeper checks an app, which is a directory. The mark is written before the file's time, which writing a stream changes. A mark that cannot be written stops the extraction (`ErrorKind::Origin`), and so does one this system cannot carry, before anything is written: an extraction that drops the mark would hide where its files came from. It is not the default only because the archive's path is the caller's: `extract_zip` reads an `Archive`, not a file.

Linux and the other systems have no mark (`Origin::of` gives `None`). macOS's attribute takes `rustix`, a dependency with `unsafe` code, already there for `cap-std`, since the standard library has no extended attributes (see [safety.md](safety.md#dependencies-with-unsafe-code)).

## Time, cancelling and progress

The limits bound what an archive writes, not how long it takes: a disk that is slow, or many small entries, take their time within them. `Options::time_limit` (none by default) stops an extraction once past it, from when it starts (`ErrorKind::TimeLimit`), and `Cancel`, a token whose clones share one flag, stops it from another thread (`ErrorKind::Cancelled`). Both are checked between entries and before each read of data, which gives at most 64 KiB; a read of compressed data that gives nothing, such as empty Deflate blocks, runs to the end of that entry's data, which the archive's size bounds. A file cut off is removed, as one whose data fails; what was written before stays.

`Options::progress` is told the entries and bytes to write once the entries are checked, as the archive says them (the data is checked against them, so what is written does not pass them), then the entries and bytes written after each piece of data and each entry. It is called on the extracting thread, and should hand on what it is told, not wait. Calling `Cancel::cancel` from it stops the extraction.

The research behind this plan found neither in any Rust ZIP crate, so the design is this crate's own: a token and a function, rather than an asynchronous interface, as the writing blocks anyway.

## Options

Each rule that is not about writing outside the destination can be relaxed, by name (`Options`):

| Option | Default | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| `links` | `Links::Refuse` | `AsFile`: a file holding the target, as extractors on Windows write links. `Inside`: links whose target is relative and stays inside the destination by its text (`..` allowed, as long as it does not climb out), and does not pass through another link of the archive, which the system would follow where the text does not; read and checked before anything is written, and created after every other entry, so nothing is written through them. On Windows, creating a link takes a privilege that most accounts lack |
| `names` | `Names::Strict` | `Sanitize`: first drops what Python's `zipfile` drops, a leading `/`, a drive (`C:`, a letter and a colon, as Windows reads it) and `.`, `..` and empty components, then refuses what is still refused |
| `backslash_separator` | `false` | `\` taken for a separator, as PowerShell 5.1's `Compress-Archive` writes it |
| `on_refused` | `OnRefused::Stop` | `Skip`: an entry refused for its name, as a link or as the same path as another is left out, listed in `Summary::skipped` with its reason, and the rest extracted. The limits and overlapping data still stop the extraction: they are about the archive, not one entry |
| `overwrite` | `false` | Files that are there are replaced, if they are files: opened without following a link and emptied. A link or a directory there still stops it |
| `permissions` | `Permissions::Masked` | `Preserve`: the entry's bits but setuid, setgid and sticky. `Ignore`: the system's |
| `limits` | see [Limits](#limits) | each raised or lowered |
| `password` | none | the password encrypted entries are read with |
| `origin` | none | the archive's mark of origin (`Origin::of`), carried to every file (see [Marks of origin](#marks-of-origin)) |
| `time_limit` | none | how long the extraction may take (see [Time, cancelling and progress](#time-cancelling-and-progress)) |
| `cancel` | none | a `Cancel` token that stops it |
| `progress` | none | a function told how far it is |

## tar

A tar archive has no central directory: each header comes before its data, one after the other, often inside a compressor (`.tar.gz`, `.tar.zst`) or age (`.tar.zst.age`). To check every entry before anything is written, as for ZIP, `extract_tar` reads it twice, through a function that opens it again (and so decompresses or decrypts it again): first the headers, the data skipped, for every check of the plan; then the entries are written, each header compared with the first reading's, its type, name, link target and size, and an archive that is not the one checked stops (`ErrorKind::Changed`) at the first that differs, or where the readings end differently. Data cut short stops the first reading, before anything is written; a file whose data fails in the second is removed.

What differs from ZIP:

- **`./`**: `tar -cf x.tar .` writes every name with a leading `./`, which is dropped; `./` itself, the archive's root, is not an entry. Every other `.` component is refused, as in ZIP.
- **Symbolic links** take their target from the header, not the data; the options are ZIP's.
- **Hard links** are a second name for a file the archive extracted before them: the target, a name in the archive (`./` dropped, the same rules), must be such a file, kept and earlier, or the link is refused (`ErrorKind::HardLinkTarget`, or `LinkTarget` for a target refused as a name). So a hard link can neither lead outside nor reach a file that was there before. It is created as a hard link inside the destination, by handle; with `Links::AsFile`, as a copy, which counts against the limits as written data.
- **Devices and FIFOs** have no data in tar, only what to create, and nothing is created as one: they are refused (`ErrorKind::Special`), or left out with `OnRefused::Skip`.
- **Global PAX headers and GNU volume labels** describe the archive, and are not entries. GNU's dump directories (`D`) are directories; every other type is a regular file, as GNU tar and Python take them.
- **Sizes**: tar does not compress, so there is no ratio to check here; the compressor's ratio is its own. A sparse file's holes are written as zeros, and count against the limits.
- **Every entry counts against `max_entries`**, metadata too, so that an archive of global headers does not grow the first reading's list without end.
- **The stream is read to its end.** A tar reader stops at the archive's end, but a compressor checks its data at the end of its stream (gzip's and bzip2's CRC-32, xz's and zstd's checks), and age authenticates its last chunk there. Each reading goes on to the end, as GNU tar reads its compressor's output to the end, so that a stream that fails its check fails the first reading, before anything is written (`ErrorKind::Io`). What follows the archive's end is limited to `max_total_size`, or 1 MiB if that is less, the largest record tar pads to. [open.md](open.md) opens archives through those layers.

## cpio

`extract_cpio` extracts the cpio archives `hivepack-cpio` reads: Linux's initramfs images, RPM packages' payloads (taken out of the package and decompressed by [open.md](open.md)'s layers), and what `cpio` writes. As tar's, an archive is a run of headers each before its data, so it is read twice, through a function that opens it again, each header compared with the first reading's (all of it). The first reading skips the data, which reads it through: an archive cut short, or without `TRAILER!!!`, stops it before anything is written. cpio has no checksums to check but crc's, which libarchive does not check either.

What differs from tar:

- **`.`**, the root directory, is not an entry (`find . | cpio` writes it); names drop a leading `./`, with every rule of [the names](#refuse-do-not-repair).
- **Entries after garbage** come from `hivepack-cpio` with libarchive's warning, "Skipped N bytes before finding valid header": what was passed over is lost. They are refused (`ErrorKind::CpioEntry`), or left out with `OnRefused::Skip`. libarchive's search goes through what cannot be a header six bytes at a time, and finds a newc header only where it lands on it: after other garbage, the archive reads to its end without the header, and fails there.
- **Hard links** are the entries libarchive gives as another name for an earlier one (the same device and inode), and a file's data comes with any of its names: with the last in newc, as GNU cpio and RPM write it, the others empty; with each in odc. libarchive's extraction writes each entry's data into the file the names share, so that it holds the last data written. Here the file is written once, under its first name, when the last of its entries with data comes; its other names are then linked to it, or copied with `Links::AsFile`, and those that come after it as they come. The limits count the file once, at the size of that data, before anything is written.
- **Devices, FIFOs and sockets** are refused (`ErrorKind::Special`), as tar's: an initramfs image's `/dev/console` among them, which `OnRefused::Skip` leaves out.

## ISO 9660

`extract_iso` extracts the ISO 9660 images `hivepack-iso` reads (CD and DVD images, Linux installers, `.iso.xz` through [open.md](open.md)'s layers), as `extract_tar` extracts tar: an image is read in order, as libarchive reads one without seeking, so it is read twice, through a function that opens it again, each header compared with the first reading's (all of it: path, mode, owner, times, links, size). The first reading reads each file's data too, up to its size, and drops it: skipping it would read it anyway from an input that cannot seek, and so data cut short or damaged (a zisofs block that does not decompress) stops the extraction before anything is written, where tar's first reading finds only what precedes the last header.

What differs from tar:

- **`.`**, the root directory, is not an entry. Names are Rock Ridge's, else Joliet's in UTF-8, else ISO 9660's without their `;1`, with every rule of [the names](#refuse-do-not-repair): a Rock Ridge name is any bytes, `../escape` included.
- **Entries with something missing** come from `hivepack-iso` with a warning, libarchive's `ARCHIVE_WARN`: a directory left out with all it holds (before the place read to, or past the image's end), a file past the image's end, a file whose data is before its directory (which an input that cannot seek cannot go back for), a Joliet name or link target that is not UTF-16. They are refused (`ErrorKind::IsoEntry`), or left out with `OnRefused::Skip`, as a refused name is. A part of a file's data out of place, found while reading it, stops the first reading.
- **Hard links** are the entries libarchive gives as a second name for the file before them (the same serial number): created as tar's are, or copied with `Links::AsFile`.
- **Devices, FIFOs and sockets** from Rock Ridge are refused (`ErrorKind::Special`), as tar's.
- **Permissions**: an image without Rock Ridge has none, and libarchive's 0400 and 0700 are its own, so its files and directories get the system's defaults; Rock Ridge's are masked as ZIP's and tar's.
- **Sizes**: a file is written to its size. A zisofs file's data, as libarchive gives it, can stop before (the blocks of zeros at its end are left out) or, damaged, go on past it: the file is made its size with zeros, and what is past it is not read, as libarchive's extraction (`archive_write_disk`) does. zisofs's compression is not counted against `max_ratio`, as the image does not say how much each file takes; the limits on sizes stand.

## UDF

`extract_udf` extracts the UDF volumes `hivepack-udf` mounts (DVD, Blu-ray and Windows' images, which [open.md](open.md) tells, with ISO 9660 beside UDF or not). A volume is read by random access, as a ZIP archive is, so it is read once: its tree is walked first, parents before what they hold, every node read, every file's data checked to be on the image without reading it (`Udf::check_data`), every link's target read, and every entry checked, before anything is written; then the files are written, each read where it is. The caller mounts the volume: `hivepack_udf::Options::unhide` lists the entries a volume hides (Windows marks hidden files so), which NetBSD and Linux leave out, as `extract_udf` then does.

What differs from tar:

- **The root directory** is not an entry, and `..` is not either. Names are the volume's, translated as NetBSD translates them for UNIX (a slash or NUL becomes `_`, then the name ends with `#` and its CRC), with every rule of [the names](#refuse-do-not-repair): a name in a character set other than OSTA's is its bytes, refused if they are not UTF-8.
- **What cannot be read is refused** (`ErrorKind::Udf`): an entry whose node, data or link target does not read (an image cut short, allocation descriptors that do not cover a file, a link recorded as text, as macOS's `hdiutil` records them), and a directory with a broken entry, whose entries after it are missing; or left out with `OnRefused::Skip`, but a broken root directory, which stops the extraction. Everything is found before anything is written, so an image cut short in a file's data stops the extraction with nothing written.
- **Hard links** are the entries that name a node another entry named first: created as tar's are, or copied with `Links::AsFile`. A directory named twice, or its own ancestor, which UDF does not allow, is refused (`ErrorKind::DirectoryAgain`), and its tree is not walked again.
- **Devices, FIFOs and sockets** are refused (`ErrorKind::Special`), as tar's, and so are the nodes NetBSD gives no type.
- **Sizes**: a file is written to its size; what is not recorded (a sparse file's holes) is zeros, and counts against the limits. A volume does not compress, so there is no ratio to check, and a file's extents are not compared with others': many files on the same blocks write no more than the limits let them.

## Errors

An extraction stops at the first entry refused (unless `on_refused` is `Skip`), with its index, its name as the archive has it, and the reason (`Error`, `ErrorKind`). What is checked before writing (names, the same path, links, overlaps, declared sizes) stops it before anything is written, the destination included.

## How it is shown

`crates/extract/tests/extract.rs` extracts archives made to attack extractors, written by `hivepack-zip` and changed by hand where it would not write them: names that climb, are absolute, carry backslashes, drives, streams, device names or control characters (as CP437 too); the same path in two cases, as a file and a directory; links; FIFOs and devices, written as files; links already in the destination, to a directory and to a file outside it (Unix); files already there; the limits; two entries sharing one stream, as Fifield's bombs do; data whose CRC-32 fails, and more data than the header says; and encrypted entries, with and without the password. Each must stop with its reason, leave nothing outside the destination, and nothing at all when the checks before writing stop it. Each option has its test: links inside, climbing out, absolute and through another link; links as files; names cleaned up and backslashes; entries skipped; files overwritten but not links; permissions kept or left; directory times; a time limit of zero and one too far to count; cancelling before and in the middle of a file, which is removed; and progress, its totals told first, never going back, in pieces of 64 KiB at most. The name rules have unit tests of their own, and random bytes are checked without panicking.

The same test extracts every archive of libzip's `regress/` that opens with `ZIP_CHECKCONS` (112 of 180), beside a file that must stay as it was. 81 extract; 28 stop on their data, as they were made to (wrong passwords, CRC errors, garbage after a stream, a damaged bzip2 stream, and LZMA, XZ and Zstandard, which the port does not read yet); 3 stop on their names (an empty one, and two whose CP437 names have control characters). It was this run that found the FIFOs of `streamed.zip`, which were refused before they were written as files.

Fifield's three published bombs (the `fifield-zipbombs` set) stop before anything is written, whether opened with `ZIP_CHECKCONS` or not: libzip's consistency check passes them, as their local headers agree with the central directory. With the default limits, `zbsm.zip` (250 entries, 42 kB to 5.5 GB) stops on its shared data, as its 5.5 GB pass the limits; without the overlap check it writes them all, which is how the test was checked. `zblg.zip` (10 MB to 281 TB) stops on the sizes it declares, and `zbxl.zip` (190,023 entries, 46 MB to 4.5 PB) on its number of entries. With those limits lifted, each stops on its shared data, once the entries refused are skipped: the names of the two big ones, every name of digits and capital letters of one character, then of two, then of three, include `AUX`, `CON`, `NUL` and `PRN`, which are refused on every system. The test sets a ratio of ten to one throughout, checked only while writing, so that a bomb let through stops within its first entry rather than fill the disk.

ZipDiff's archives (the `zipdiff-constructions` set: 5,927 archives that ZIP parsers read differently, made once by ZipDiff's own program) each extract or stop with their reason, opened with `ZIP_CHECKCONS` and without, and the test holds the count of each outcome for each type, so that a change shows. `hivepack-zip` reads every one as libzip does (see [zip.md](zip.md)), so what is extracted is what libzip reads. With `ZIP_CHECKCONS`, most of those whose headers disagree do not open (4,248 of `a2`'s 4,609 size combinations, every several-ends archive of `c2`, the moved central directory of `c4`). The name rules refuse every one of `b3`'s twenty forms of `a/b` (`/a/b`, `a//b`, `a\b`, `./a/b`, `../a/b`, `.../a/b`, `c/../a/b`...), whichever comes first, and the same path stops `b1` (one name twice, without the check) and `b4` (`test.txt` and `test.TXT`). The data that overlaps stops one of `c1`'s. It was this run that found the characters Windows does not allow (`a<b`, `a*b` and the others of `b2`), which were extracted on Linux and would have failed on Windows; they are refused now.

`crates/extract/tests/tar.rs` does the same for tar, with archives the test writes: names that climb, are absolute, carry backslashes, drives, devices or control characters, or are not UTF-8; the same path, as `./` and without, and in two cases; symbolic links refused, as files, and inside, with targets climbing out, absolute or through another link; hard links to an earlier file (the same inode on Unix), as copies, and to nothing, to a later file, outside or to a directory; devices and FIFOs, refused and skipped; the limits; archives cut in the middle of a file and headers that say more than the archive holds, which stop before anything is written; an archive that changes between its readings (another name, another size, an entry more or fewer), which writes nothing the first reading did not check; a stream that fails after the archive's end, in the first reading or the second, and what follows the end past its limit; a time limit; and files already there. Each of Go's 38 plain test archives (`testdata/go-tar`) is extracted with `OnRefused::Stop` and `Skip` beside a file that must stay as it was, and the test holds each outcome: links and a FIFO refused or left out, names that are not UTF-8, the archives Go's reader refuses, and `writer-big.tar`, whose 16 GiB file is cut short.

`crates/extract/tests/cpio.rs` does the same for cpio, with archives the test writes in newc and odc: directories, files and a name in UTF-8 under `.`, with their times and masked permissions; a file's three names with the data on the last (newc, as GNU cpio writes it), on each (odc), on the first, and other data on the others, each name holding the last data, one inode on Unix, and copies with `Links::AsFile`; names of a file with no data; the limit on an entry stopping the data on a file's last name before anything is written; names that climb out, absolute, with a backslash or a Windows device name, refused or skipped; the same path in two cases, and twice, the second a hard link by its own name (which the fuzz target found taken for its own file); symbolic links refused, as files, inside and climbing out; a device; an archive cut in its data, in its trailer and in its first header; an entry after garbage, refused or skipped, and after garbage libarchive's search does not get through; an archive that changes between its readings. libarchive's cpio test archives (the `libarchive-cpio` set) are each extracted with links as files and entries refused left out: afio's two parts, each one archive cut short, stop; the others extract, the names that are not UTF-8 (CP866, KOI8-R, EUC-JP) and those the same but for case (`ПРИВЕТ` and `привет`) skipped.

`crates/extract/tests/iso.rs` does the same for ISO 9660, with images the test makes with Rock Ridge (names as any bytes, symbolic links in SL components, devices in PN, hard links by the same extent and serial number, zisofs) and without: names that climb out (`../escape`, `..`, absolute, `con`, `a:b`), refused or skipped; the same path in two cases; symbolic links refused, as files, inside and climbing out; a hard link, and its copy; a device; the limits on an entry, on all of them and on their number; an image cut in its last file's data, which the first reading reads, so that nothing is written; a zisofs file with blocks of zeros in its middle and at its end, written to its size; a file past the image's end, which libarchive gives with a warning, refused and skipped; an image that changes between its readings; and files with Rock Ridge's permissions and with the system's, without it. Each of libarchive's 22 test images (`testdata/libarchive-iso`) is extracted with each choice of links, entries refused left out, and nothing must be written beside the destination: four stop on the damage they were made with (a Joliet path too long, CE areas in a loop and past the block, CL and RE in a cycle), the others extract. It was this run that found that libarchive leaves out the blocks of zeros at a zisofs file's end (`test_read_format_iso_zisofs`'s file of 12 MB reads as 32 KiB), which libarchive's own extraction fills in.

`crates/extract/tests/udf.rs` extracts six of `testdata/udf`'s volumes ([udf.md](udf.md): mkudffs's on a hard disk at UDF 1.02 and 2.01, with blocks of 512 and 4096 bytes, on a CD-RW's sparable partition, on a DVD-R's VAT, and genisoimage's beside ISO 9660), with links as files and, on Unix, inside, entries refused left out: every file's SHA-256 is the one Linux reads, every directory and link is there, and what is not is refused for its name (`a:b*c?d "e" <f>|g\h`), its kind (a FIFO, devices) or its link's target (`/etc/passwd`); the hard link is one inode. By default the first refusal stops it before anything is written. A file whose extent is moved past its partition, as an image cut short has it, is refused, or stops the extraction with nothing written; and a directory's FID made to name the root, a loop, is refused, the rest written.

The `extract` fuzz target (see [fuzz/README.md](../fuzz/README.md)) extracts its input with options its first byte picks, cancelling it after some progress if that byte says so, and checks that nothing is written beside the destination, that every link created stays inside it by its text, that the summary counts what is there, and, however the extraction ends, that the files left hold exactly the bytes of the entries written in full, so that none is left cut off. 11 million inputs over four minutes found nothing before the first commit, and 9.6 million with cancelling; with the removal of a failed file taken out, it fails on the seed corpus, before mutating anything.

The `extract_tar` fuzz target does the same for tar, seeded with Go's test archives behind a choice of options, a hard link's file counted once. Its first three minutes found that the progress totals left out what links written as files write (a symbolic link's target, a hard link's copy), so that progress passed its total; they count it now, which `tests/tar.rs` checks. The next three minutes, 5.4 million inputs, found nothing, and three more, 3.6 million, once each reading went on to the end of the stream.

## The archives behind CVEs

`crates/extract/tests/cves.rs` makes again the kind of archive each of these advisories describes, and checks that it stops before anything is written, or writes only inside the destination, with the reason the table gives. The Windows and macOS rows run on those systems in CI.

| Advisory | In | The archive | Stopped by | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2025-29787 (RUSTSEC-2025-0168) | the `zip` crate | a link, then a file written through it | links refused; allowed, a file under a link is the same path as the link (`Duplicate`), and a target that climbs out is refused | `cve_2025_29787_a_file_through_a_link_of_the_archive` |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0367 | the `zip` crate | setuid, setgid and sticky bits | masked, by default and by every option | `rustsec_2026_0367_setuid_and_setgid_bits` |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0368 | the `zip` crate | links to `/etc/passwd` and climbing out | links refused (`Link`, or `LinkTarget` when allowed); written as files, they hold only their text | `rustsec_2026_0368_links_to_outside` |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0369 | the `zip` crate | a link to a file outside, then an entry of the same name whose permissions went through the link | the same path twice (`Duplicate`), the target refused, and permissions set on the file's handle; the file outside keeps its mode | `rustsec_2026_0369_permissions_through_a_link` |
| CVE-2026-76845 | adm-zip | links already in the destination, to a directory and a file outside | directories opened without following a link (`NotADirectory`), files created new (`Exists`), with `overwrite` too | `cve_2026_76845_links_already_in_the_destination` |
| CVE-2026-39244 | adm-zip | 120 bytes that declare 4 GB, allocated | nothing allocated from a declared size, what is written counted (`SizeMismatch`), a lower `max_entry_size` before anything is written; stored data that short, libzip refuses | `cve_2026_39244_a_declared_size_is_not_allocated` |
| CVE-2026-92000 | adm-zip | an entry that declares no data, which skipped the output limit | the first byte past what it declares (`SizeMismatch`) | `cve_2026_92000_an_entry_that_declares_nothing` |
| CVE-2024-0450 | CPython's `zipfile` | quoted-overlap bombs | data that overlaps (`Overlap`); Fifield's `zbsm.zip` is one | `cve_2024_0450_entries_that_share_one_stream`, and `extract::fifield_zip_bombs_write_nothing` |
| CVE-2023-38831, exploited | WinRAR | a file and a folder of one name, `report.pdf ` and `report.pdf /` | the trailing space; without it, the same path | `cve_2023_38831_a_file_and_a_folder_of_one_name` |
| CVE-2013-4787 (Master Key) | Android | one name twice, one checked and the other used | libzip's consistency check at opening; without it, the same path | `cve_2013_4787_one_name_twice` |
| CVE-2021-37712 | node-tar | a link and a directory whose names are one once normalized | names compared by their key (`Duplicate`) | `cve_2021_37712_a_link_and_a_directory_one_by_normalization` |
| CVE-2025-8088, exploited | WinRAR | NTFS streams whose names climb with `..\` to the Startup folder | the backslash, and the colon with backslashes as separators or names cleaned up | `cve_2025_8088_streams_that_climb` |
| CVE-2026-58052 | 7-Zip | streams `:Zone.Identifier:$DATA` and `::$DATA`, over the file's mark and data | the colon; skipped, the file alone is written | `cve_2026_58052_streams_that_replace_the_mark` |
| CVE-2025-0411, exploited | 7-Zip | the Mark of the Web lost through an archive inside an archive | every file gets the archive's mark, an inner archive too, and what is extracted from it (Windows) | `cve_2025_0411_the_mark_through_nested_archives` |
| CVE-2021-1810 | macOS's Archive Utility | no quarantine on paths longer than 886 characters | the mark set on each file's descriptor, whatever its path (macOS) | `cve_2021_1810_the_quarantine_on_long_paths` |
| CVE-2022-42821 (Achilles) | macOS | an AppleDouble file beside an app, whose ACL kept the quarantine from being set | AppleDouble files written as the files they are, never applied (macOS) | `cve_2022_42821_appledouble_is_not_applied` |

Two are not made again: macOS's CVE-2026-28849 ("a maliciously crafted ZIP archive may bypass Gatekeeper checks") says no more than that, and Python's tarfile CVEs of June 2025 (CVE-2025-4517 and the others) are tar's, and come next.

## What comes next

- **RAR**, through the same checks and writing.
- **Sparse files written with holes**, rather than zeros.
- **The tar archives behind Python's tarfile CVEs** of June 2025, made again as these are.
