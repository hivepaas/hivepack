# Test data

[manifest.json](manifest.json) lists every set of test files: where it came from, its license, and what it holds.

- **Committed sets** are in this folder. Each source keeps its license file next to its data.
- **Fetched sets** are downloaded by `scripts/testdata.py`, checked against the SHA-256 in the manifest, and unpacked into `target/testdata/<set>`. Setting `HIVEPACK_TESTDATA` puts them somewhere else.
- **Generated sets** are made in the same place by zstd's own `decodecorpus` tool, or are the oracle programs in `tools/`. The script builds them from the zstd 1.5.7, zlib 1.3.2, bzip2 1.0.8, lz4 1.10.0, XZ Utils 5.8.4, libzip 1.12.1, nettle 3.10.2, 7-Zip 26.05, libarchive 3.8.10 and libxml2 2.15.4 releases with the system C compiler (and zstd's Makefile for `decodecorpus`, and 7-Zip's for `7zz`), and `tools/age-oracle` and `tools/tar-oracle` with Go, which downloads the modules their `go.sum` pins.

```sh
python3 scripts/testdata.py fetch                  # the core sets: a 16 MB download
python3 scripts/testdata.py fetch --group all      # everything: 129 MB to download, 734 MB unpacked
python3 scripts/testdata.py list                   # every set, and where it lives
```

Tests skip a set that has not been fetched and print a note. CI sets `HIVEPACK_TESTDATA_REQUIRED` (for example to `core,generated`), and then a missing set fails the test instead.

## What a set holds

Each set has a `kind`:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `frames` | Every `.zst` file decodes. `originals: beside` means `x.zst` decodes to `x` whenever that file exists, and `zeros` lists frames that decode to runs of zero bytes. |
| `bad-frames` | Every `.zst` file fails to decode. |
| `inputs` | Every file is data to compress. |
| `dictionaries` | Every file is a dictionary, with inputs to compress using it. |
| `dict-frames` | `.dict` files are dictionaries, and each frame decodes with the one its header names. |
| `fuzz` | Inputs that fuzzers found or used. No outcome is expected; they are for comparing against libzstd and for checking that nothing panics. |
| `archives` | Archives for hivepack-extract's tests, kept as they were published and never unpacked; what each must do is in the test that reads it. |

`expect` marks files whose outcome differs from their kind, with the reason. The outcome is always libzstd 1.5.7's, even where the source of the file expected another one. `crates/zstd/tests/testdata.rs` checks every expectation against libzstd 1.5.7.
